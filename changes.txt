Our original design template provided us a good base for our project, but as we
began work we realized we were missing some key components. First of all, our
page organization needed to be amended. Originally we did not know how we were
going to present the stories to the users. During our work process we decided to
have a page for editing a story, viewing a story, and creating a story. Secondly,
we did not think to have password encryption in our software. However, after
discussing with Mr. Dyrland-Weaver he wisely suggested that we should implement
password hashing for user security. We also decided to have only one database for
all of our data, instead of having an individual database for login info and
another for holding stories.

For the most part our original design guided us in the right direction but did
need a few tweaks as we coded our assignment.
